pricepi-PHP-client
==================

A PHP client wrapper for the Pricepi retail intelligence API

Simply include pricepi-rest.php in your code. Then pass the
appropriate arguments to call_pricepi() and collect 
the results in the return!

Take a look at example.php to see how to make an API call and 
then output the results via echo.

Enjoy.
